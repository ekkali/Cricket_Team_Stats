This project aims to develop a Cricket Team Stats application using Spring Boot. The application will provide functionalities to manage and analyze cricket team statistics including player information, match details, and performance analytics.

Features
Player Management: Allows adding, updating, and removing player details such as name, age, role, and statistics.
Match Management: Enables recording match details including opponent, venue, date, and outcome.
Statistics Analysis: Provides analytical insights into player and team performance based on recorded match data.
User Authentication and Authorization: Secure access control to different features based on user roles.
RESTful API: Exposes REST endpoints for seamless integration with other applications or front-end frameworks.
Database Integration: Utilizes a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for persistent storage of team and player information.
Frontend Interface: Optionally, integrates with a frontend interface (e.g., Angular, React) for user interaction.
Technologies Used
Spring Boot: Framework for building and deploying Java-based applications with ease.
Spring Data JPA: Simplifies the implementation of data access layer using JPA (Java Persistence API).
Spring Security: Provides authentication and authorization support for securing the application.
MySQL/PostgreSQL: Relational database management system for storing application data.
RESTful Web Services: Implements REST APIs for communication with the frontend or other applications.
Thymeleaf/Freemarker/React/Angular: Options for frontend technologies to build the user interface.
